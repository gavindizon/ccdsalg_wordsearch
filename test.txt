The goal of this game is for the players to reach retirement as early as possible with the most savings on hand. The player decides what kind of life he wants to experience during the game. At the start of each round, the player press for a randomly generated number [1-10]. This determines the number of spaces he will advance on the board. Unlike the usual board games, where there is only one path from start to end, That's Life!, at some areas along the way, present players with two options: to continue moving forward, or to take a shorter (or maybe longer) route to reach another space on the board.
